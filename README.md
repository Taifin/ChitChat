# ChitChat - virtual space to hangout with friends and play simple arcades

### Decriprion:

ChitChat is a QT-based C++ application, that allows people to visit virtual rooms, talk with friends via voice chat and play videogames, such as Arkanoid, Hangman, etc. It is a semester project made by first-year bachelors of HSE SPb AMI.

ChitChat comes with three major parts, that have to be built and used separately: server-side application, client-side application and games in form of shared libraries.

* **Server:** `cmake --build $DIR --target ChitChatServer`, compile with `-DLOCAL` flag to run server on localhost. 
* **Client:** `cmake --build $DIR --target ChitChatClient`, compile with `-DLOCAL` flag to connect to server on localhost.
* **Games:** `cmake --build $DIR -- target "name"`.
